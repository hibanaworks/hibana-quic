// # Unsafe Owner Contract
//
// This file owns dynamic resolver erased-storage dispatch for the session
// cluster. Resolver registration records one typed state pointer together with
// the matching trampoline; invocation must use the registration for that exact
// `(program image, resolver id)`. Route scope remains immutable descriptor
// authority, while every matching site in one program shares this callback.
// The resident resolver table is supplied by the cluster storage owner and
// bound/rebound only through the explicit storage-layout paths in this module.
// Slot contents are initialized optional bucket entries, and the raw state
// pointer is never exposed outside the resolver dispatch boundary.
