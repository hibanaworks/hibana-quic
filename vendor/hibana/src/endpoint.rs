//! Role-local endpoint facade.
//!
//! An [`Endpoint`] is the app-facing affine executor for one projected role. It
//! is created by [`crate::runtime::SessionKit`] and then advanced with the
//! role-local operations: [`Endpoint::send`], [`Endpoint::recv`],
//! [`Endpoint::offer`], [`RouteBranch::send`], and [`RouteBranch::recv`].
//!
//! `offer` is a non-consuming route preview.
//! Committed progress happens when a send, receive, or route branch first-step
//! operation succeeds.
//! Committed endpoint failures return [`EndpointError`] as diagnostic evidence
//! and poison the current session generation; they do not authorize hidden
//! alternate progress.
//! Successful sends, receives, and route branch first-step operations consume
//! progress. Dropped unpolled sends do not publish runtime progress; dropped
//! in-flight sends and route previews restore their resident endpoint state.
//!
//! # Unsafe Owner Contract
//!
//! This module owns only the app-facing raw future and route-branch handles.
//! Unsafe operations dereference the carrier header installed by the rendezvous
//! endpoint owner; the endpoint borrow guarantees exclusive role-local access,
//! and every raw future either completes, restores preview state, or fails fast
//! on post-ready reuse.
