//! Transport abstraction bridging Hibana frames onto concrete mediums.
//!
//! Implementations are expected to integrate with external async runtimes via
//! explicit `poll_*` methods. The transport owns whatever pending state and
//! waker bookkeeping it needs inside its `Tx` / `Rx` handles or shared state.
//!
//! Receive buffers must be exposed as borrowed views. Transport implementations
//! keep receive storage inside their `Rx` handle or medium-owned state so
//! [`Transport::poll_recv`] yields payload views without allocating. This keeps
//! the runtime allocation-free while allowing DMA/SHM backed zero-copy paths.
//!
//! Implementations also bridge device interrupts to the task waker stored by
//! their pending send/recv state. When a poll parks it must record the current
//! [`core::task::Waker`] so the interrupt handler can call `wake_by_ref`
//! instead of relying on polling loops.

/// Unexpected, repeated, missing, or ambiguous evidence fails closed; it is
/// never normalized into progress; successful `poll_send` does not prove delivery.
/// Global fidelity and progress additionally assume affine delivery: accepted
/// observations are bound to the mapped peer/direction, FIFO without unsolicited
/// replay, and eventually arrive or end in terminal closure. Otherwise the
/// protocol must make loss, retry, and freshness explicit. Exact local safety remains,
/// but global theorems require that premise; `requeue` never creates a commit.
/// A terminal fault may abandon locally accepted sends not yet exposed to the
/// receiver. Such frames must not appear after closure or in another generation.
/// Reusing `SessionId` requires fresh carrier-owned receive state. A fresh
/// transport instance provides it. Address migration or identifier rotation within the

/// implement this trait. Replayable early data may be exposed only after the
/// carrier or application profile has made it safe for Hibana's no-replay
/// contract; otherwise it must be rejected or delayed.
/// The strong affine-delivery profile also requires observable peer closure:
/// after accepted FIFO frames drain, a parked or later
/// [`poll_recv`](Transport::poll_recv) must wake and return
/// [`TransportError::Offline`] or [`TransportError::Failed`]. This is the
/// distributed cancellation boundary when a faulted endpoint retires handles.
/// It is a logical Hibana direction, not necessarily the physical connection:
/// a multiplexed carrier can retire one substream and leave others alive.
/// Retiring every handle for that direction must signal the remote direction.
