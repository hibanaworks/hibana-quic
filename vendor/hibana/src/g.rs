//! Choreography language used by app authors.
//!
//! `g` is the only app-facing language layer. Build local choreography terms
//! with [`send`], [`seq`], [`route`], and [`par`], then let a protocol crate
//! project and attach them.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use hibana::g;
//!
//! let request = g::send::<0, 1, g::Msg<1, u32>>();
//! let reply = g::send::<1, 0, g::Msg<2, u32>>();
//! let program = g::seq(request, reply);
//! ```
//!
//! A [`Msg`] is a typed message descriptor:
//!
//! ```text
//! Msg<LOGICAL_LABEL, Payload>
//! ```
//!
//! Labels identify choreography messages. Intrinsic routes derive branch
//! authority from first-visible endpoint evidence; resolved routes derive it
//! from [`ResolverRef::decide`](crate::runtime::resolver::ResolverRef::decide).
//! Labels do not encode transport demux or hidden runtime semantics.
//!
//! Dynamic branch resolver is supplied by runtime resolvers. Runtime hints or
//! payload contents do not create route authority by themselves.
