# Lean verification

This host-only package verifies Hibana's normalized choreography, descriptor,
and execution models with Lean Core and Std. It is outside the Cargo workspace
and contributes no code, metadata, memory use, or flash cost to Pico builds.

The model specifies Hibana's finite-role, non-delegating protocol kernel. It is
not a source-level verification of arbitrary Rust code or a specification of a
concrete transport.

## Checked boundary

For an accepted choreography and its exact role descriptors, the Lean
development establishes:

- projection and projectability for `send`, `seq`, `par`, `route`, and `roll`;
- exact preservation of event identity, direction, peer, logical label,
  canonical wire schema, lane, route membership, and frame label;
- rejection of malformed descriptors, ambiguous inbound observations,
  mismatched operations, unresolved choices, duplicate resolution, and invalid
  compact values without committing protocol state;
- subject reduction, session fidelity, route agreement, and unique message
  consumption for the global asynchronous model;
- correspondence between distributed role-local execution and global
  transitions for accepted finite-state protocol artifacts;
- protocol progress for covered reachable states, subject to the scheduling and
  carrier premises below;
- affine cancellation, first-fault preservation, queue quarantine, waiter
  release, and finite retirement for covered finite transport states;
- guarded repeated-region reset, FIFO or causal re-entry freshness, and erasure
  of proof-only occurrence history from descriptors, frames, endpoint types,
  and runtime state;
- isolation, removal, and fresh re-attachment of independent sessions;
- soundness of compact layout, allocation, public-operation transition, codec,
  deployment, and production-kernel artifacts;
- composition of verified protocol artifacts with explicit deployment,
  carrier, codec, and production-kernel evidence.

The principal externally relevant claim types are listed in
[`ClaimSurface.lean`](ClaimSurface.lean). The complete elaborated theorem
inventories are machine-checked snapshots, not prose maintained in this file.

## Required evidence

The strongest end-to-end conclusions require all of the following:

1. Every role uses the exact accepted descriptor image for the same
   choreography.
2. Peers agree on each canonical wire schema and use conforming codecs.
3. The deployment supplies the carrier properties required by its selected
   profile: mediation, peer authenticity, FIFO and replay exclusion, observable
   close or abort, and fairness where liveness is claimed.
4. The executor eventually polls operations that remain enabled.
5. Production Rust supplies the prepare/commit refinement and ownership
   evidence required by `ProductionEndToEnd.lean`.

These are explicit premises. Lean does not infer remote installation agreement,
transport authentication, delivery, failure detection, or scheduler fairness
from the `Transport` trait.

Schema equality means equality of the canonical wire contract identified by
`SCHEMA_ID`; it does not prove cross-binary Rust nominal type equality.

## Deliberate non-claims

The proof package does not claim:

- verification of arbitrary Rust source or arbitrary `Transport`
  implementations;
- correctness of cryptography, authentication mechanisms, failure detectors,
  retries, deadlines, or application scheduling;
- safety or liveness of a distributed algorithm implemented above Hibana;
- termination of an intentionally infinite `roll`;
- channel delegation, unbounded role creation, or completeness for code that
  bypasses the endpoint kernel.

In particular, route agreement assumes a conforming controller execution.
Independently fabricated observations can select different arms at different
passive roles; authenticating the fabricating controller alone does not restore
this premise. There is no Byzantine agreement theorem for that setting.

Kani, Miri, Rust tests, and carrier conformance tests provide complementary
implementation evidence. Their success is not represented as a Lean theorem
about arbitrary Rust source.

The checked claim snapshots are:

- `all-claim-surface.txt` for static theorem types;
- `example-claim-surface.txt` for finite executable regressions;
- `generated-claim-surface.txt` for generated descriptor and protocol
  certificates;
- `runtime-generated-claim-surface.txt` for runtime layout and lifecycle
  certificates;
- `public-operation-generated-claim-surface.txt` for the public-operation
  transition table;
- `causal-generated-claim-surface.txt` for finite Rust/Lean causal decisions;
- `parallel-generated-claim-surface.txt` for ten exact parallel descriptors and
  their corruption rejections, all checked with kernel evaluation.

The compiler scope memo, fork-input restoration, independent-sibling exclusion,
and retained sequential joins have general model lemmas. Ingress-head
preservation is conditional on progress outside the observed lane. Their
connection to Rust includes finite descriptor and decision correspondence;
these artifacts do not establish refinement of every Rust execution.

Sequential inputs to a fork are included in the canonical dependency columns,
including the right arm's newly introduced lane. The additional fixtures cover
`seq(send, par(send, send))` and nested sequential inputs in both role images.
The interval lemma establishes coverage of both arms; the generated exact-byte
checks compare the Rust dependency rows with this canonical model. They do not
constitute a universal proof of the Rust dependency compiler.

The gate discovers declarations from Lean source, compares their elaborated
types with these snapshots, and audits their axiom closures. Generated Rust
artifacts are accepted only when their complete theorem inventory and exact
claim types match.

Static proofs use the pinned Lean Core and Std environment. The gate rejects
custom axioms, `sorry`, and `admit`. Finite executable regressions and concrete
finite-closure artifacts that use the pinned native evaluator remain isolated
and explicitly audited; general soundness theorems do not depend on those
evaluator decisions.

## Run

From the repository root:

```sh
bash .github/scripts/check_lean_proofs.sh
```

The gate pins the Lean toolchain, builds the static package, exports the
production descriptor and kernel artifacts from Rust, checks every claim
surface, and audits the permitted proof dependencies. Its final status line is
the authoritative current inventory.
